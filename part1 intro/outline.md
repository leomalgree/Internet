## Background
Methods to manage networking tasks

#### 1, rule-based algorithms

#### 2, learning-based algorithms
    1, high model engineering cost
    2, low generalization

#### LLM method
1, large input modality gap
2, inefficiency of answer generation
3, high adaptation costs

## Innovation

### NetLLM
1, Multimodal Encoder
2, Networking head
3, DD-LRNA

### Networking Tasks
#### tasks
1, ABR 
2, CJS
3, VP
#### why these tasks

### Handling LLM challenge
1, large modality gap
2, inefficiency of token-based answer generation
3, high adaptation cost
